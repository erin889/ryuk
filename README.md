## Features:

- Translate(torso only)
- Rotation(within limit)
- Scaling(upper and lower legs only)
- Skin

Note:

- Ryuk is the death god from Death Note. He is tall, so his feet may seem hidden since this app is landscape orientation only.

- This application is developed on macOS Mojave and compatible with Android devices.

## Reference
The content for the paper doll is obtained from a portrait of Ryuk using Adobe PhotoShop Mix.
